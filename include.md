### Explore Boston Housing Data

This application is based on data originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

The Original Dataset has been obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.data) and processed as a part of peer assignment for the Coursera Course Developing Data Products.  The full description of the application is available on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/bdietz77/DD-Project-BostonHousing).

The Dataset is described in the following url [UCI MLR Archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names)

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/bdietz707/DDP-Project).

You can adjust the various Boston Housing inputs directly into the text box (or by using the left side panel buttons if you load the Shiny app locally).  The inputs are run through 5 common regressions resulting in Median Values of Homes. 

The Root Mean Squared Error is calculated once initially for each regression type.  Lower RMSE values are more accurate.
