### Explore Boston Housing Data

This application is based on data originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

The Original Dataset has been obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.data) and processed as a part of peer assignment for the Coursera Course Developing Data Products.  Full description of the processing workflow is available on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/...).

The Dataset is described in the following url [UCI MLR Archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names)

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/bdietz707/DDP-Project).

You can adjust the various Boston Housing inputs using the left side panel buttons or directly into the text box.  The inputs are run through 5 common regressions resulting in Median Values of Homes.  

The Root Mean Squared Error is calculated once initially for each regression type.  Lower RMSE values are more accurate.
